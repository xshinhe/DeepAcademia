### **DeepAcademia: Building an Agent Team to Serve Academic Research**

---

#### **Overview**

**DeepAcademia** is an ambitious project aimed at revolutionizing the landscape of academic research by developing a team of intelligent agents designed to assist, augment, and, in some cases, replace the routine tasks typically performed by junior Ph.D. students. The primary goal is to enhance research productivity, streamline workflows, and enable researchers to focus on more complex and creative aspects of their work.

This repository serves as the central hub for the development, deployment, and documentation of the **DeepAcademia Agent Team**. It includes the codebase, architecture designs, usage guidelines, and future roadmap.
